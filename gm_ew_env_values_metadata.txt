This spreadsheet includes values for garlic mustard abundance, earthworm biomass, and environmental variables including: soil temperature, pH, %carbon, and %nitrogen for all of the treatments of the eradication experiment at the 2 sites where earthworms were collected in 2017. Biomass is broken up by first and second year biomass and total biomass. Other associated variables for analysis are included.\
\

\b Columns:\

\b0 	\

\b site: 
\b0 Site where data was collected. Factor with 2 levels. See site abbreviation definitions and site treatments below.\
\

\b Treatment: 
\b0 Treatments for eradication experiment including: plots with garlic mustard (Invaded), plots removed of garlic mustard by hand-pulling (Eradicated), and plots uninvaded by garlic mustard (Control). Factor with 3 levels.\
\

\b gm:
\b0  The abundance of garlic mustard observed at each plot. \
\

\b ew: 
\b0 Earthworm biomass (g) measured at each plot.\
\

\b moisture: 
\b0 Volumetric soil moisture data values for each plot. See additional spreadsheet for conversion information.\
\

\b ph: 
\b0 soil pH for each plot, averaged from measurements taken mineral and organic layers. \
\

\b carbon: 
\b0 % carbon in the soil each plot, averaged from measurements taken from the mineral and organic layers.\
\

\b nitrogen: 
\b0 % nitrogen in the soil each plot, averaged from measurements taken from the mineral and organic layers.\
\

\b Site abbreviations and treatments:\

\b0 HF = Harvard Forest, all treatments.\
MC = McLennan Reservation, all treatments. \
